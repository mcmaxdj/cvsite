      <h2>Who Am I</h2>
      <p>My name is Maksym and I am 42 years old. Before working as a taxi driver, I was engaged in front-end development on Magento and software testing. But the war made its adjustments and I was caught in a wave of layoffs in the company where I had been working for a long time. And for a long time now I have not been able to find a job in the same direction.</p>
      <p>Now I am actively looking for a job as a quality assurance specialist.</p>
      <p>I believe that QA knows every line of code on the project and understands the product better than any person on the project. He knows all its weak points and how it can be improved! This is exactly the kind of specialist I want to be.</p>
      <p>I'm also interested in the direction of data analytics. I even learned how to write SQL queries and learned the basics of Python.</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>My professional path:</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I started out as a front-end developer at a betting company.</p>
      <p>As a front-end developer, I was involved in creating landing pages, styling them and adding interactivity. I was also involved in testing and inspecting the main site for improvements and adding new features.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I then tried my hand as a quality assurance specialist at Magecom. Where, among other things, I acquired knowledge of Magento.</p>
      <p>On the project I was involved in writing test cases, checklists, automation on cypress. As well as support for existing tests and regression testing.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>I later joined a small company from Germany and took the role of Magento front-end developer. I developed themes from scratch, extended and rewrote layouts, created CMS pages and blocks, styled them, handled translation files, added functionality to pages, and then tested. After that I created detailed documentation that was used on the project by both the developers and the customer.</p>
